<h1>{{ site.productname }} API Terms of Service</h1>

<p>Thank you for using Blackbaud's APIs, other developer services, and associated software (collectively, "APIs"). By accessing or using our APIs, you are agreeing to the terms below. If there is a conflict between these terms and additional terms applicable to a given API, the additional terms will control for that conflict. Collectively, we refer to the terms below, any additional terms, terms within the accompanying API documentation, and any applicable policies and guidelines as the "Terms." You agree to comply with the Terms and that the Terms control your relationship with us. So please read all the Terms carefully. If you use the APIs as an interface to, or in conjunction with other Blackbaud products or services, then the terms for those other products or services also apply.</p>

<p>Under the Terms, "Blackbaud" means Blackbaud Inc., with offices at 2000 Daniel Island Drive, Charleston, South Carolina 29492, United States, unless set forth otherwise in additional terms applicable for a given API. We may refer to "Blackbaud" as "we", "our", or "us" in the Terms.</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Sublicense an API for use by a third party. Consequently, you will not create an API Client that functions substantially the same as the APIs and offer it for use by third parties.</li>

          <li>Perform an action with the intent of introducing to Blackbaud products and services any viruses, worms, defects, Trojan horses, malware, or any items of a destructive nature.</li>

          <li>Defame, abuse, harass, stalk, or threaten others.</li>

          <li>Interfere with or disrupt the APIs or the servers or networks providing the APIs.</li>

          <li>Promote or facilitate unlawful online gambling or disruptive commercial messages or advertisements.</li>

          <li>Reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code from any API or any related software, except to the extent that this restriction is expressly prohibited by applicable law.</li>

          <li>Use the APIs for any activities where the use or failure of the APIs could lead to death, personal injury, or environmental damage (such as the operation of nuclear facilities, air traffic control, or life support systems).</li>

          <li>Use the APIs to process or store any data that is subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations maintained by the U.S. Department of State.</li>

        </ol>
        <p>Unless otherwise specified in writing by Blackbaud, Blackbaud does not intend use of the APIs to create obligations under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, as amended ("HIPAA"), and makes no representations that the APIs satisfy HIPAA requirements. If you are (or become) a "covered entity" or "business associate" as defined in HIPAA, you will not use the APIs for any purpose or in any manner involving transmitting protected health information to Blackbaud unless you have received prior written consent to such use from Blackbaud.</p>

        <h3 class="dcx-tos-sectionitem dcx-tos-unmarkeditem">b. Confidential Matters</h3>
<ol>
<li>Developer credentials (such as passwords, keys, and client IDs) are intended to be used by you and identify your API Client. You will keep your credentials confidential and make reasonable efforts to prevent and discourage other API Clients from using your credentials. Developer credentials may not be embedded in open source projects.</li>
<li>Our communications to you and our APIs may contain Blackbaud confidential information. Blackbaud confidential information includes any materials, communications, and information that are marked confidential or that would normally be considered confidential under the circumstances. If you receive any such information, then you will not disclose it to any third party without Blackbaud's prior written consent. Blackbaud confidential information does not include information that you independently developed, that was rightfully given to you by a third party without confidentiality obligation, or that becomes public through no fault of your own. You may disclose Blackbaud confidential information when compelled to do so by law if you provide us reasonable prior notice, unless a court orders that we not receive notice.</li>

We'll post notice of modifications to the Terms within the documentation of each applicable API, to this website, and/or in the Blackbaud developers console. Changes will not apply retroactively and will become effective no sooner than 30 days after they are posted. But changes addressing new functions for an API or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately.

The Terms do not create any third party beneficiary rights or any agency, partnership, or joint venture. Nothing in the Terms will limit either party's ability to seek injunctive relief. We are not liable for failure or delay in performance to the extent caused by circumstances beyond our reasonable control. If you do not comply with the Terms, and Blackbaud does not take action right away, this does not mean that Blackbaud is giving up any rights that it may have (such as taking action in the future). If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not affect any other terms. The Terms are the entire agreement between you and Blackbaud relating to its subject and supersede any prior or contemporaneous agreements on that subject.
