# Many resources already exist for generating, creating, and updating this site.
# The README.md and /admin/ locations are both great starts.
#
# NOTES:
#   - Please be mindful of leading and trailing slashes.  Mirror the current structure used.
#   - Unfortunately yaml doesn't have a mechanism to concat variables / strings.
#   - This means be very mindful that you may have to update URL's in a few places, ie variables and the links section.
