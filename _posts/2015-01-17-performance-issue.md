There was a performance degradation today that affected the Blackbaud RE NXT API.  Starting around 21:53 UTC a network issue caused approximately a 25% latency increase in requests. Our systems team investigated the root problem and was able to apply a fix. The increased latency lasted approximately 2 hours.  The API is now back to normal and responding to all traffic.
