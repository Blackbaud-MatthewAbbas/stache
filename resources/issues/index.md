#  Issues

<p class="alert alert-warning">Please note this is most likely a temporary page in order to highlight possible options.</p>

The ability to provide a way for developers to report issues with the API, including posting comments and seeing, is paramount in successfully deploying a successful API.  Expounding on issues and possible status updates could easily be communicated through our [blogging capability][blog] in the event the chosen Issue platform doesn't support it.

At the time of building this prototype, the issues capability built into the Microsoft Azure API Management Suite seems to still be in its infancy.  For example, listed below are just a few areas where the capabilities seem to fall short, as compared to a tool such as GitHub or comparable third-party application:

- Only able to view issues in a single view, sorted newest first
- Inability to search issues
- Inability to sort issues
- Inability to tag or label issues
- Unable to edit or delete any comments posted, even from administrators (better not make a typo)
- Statistics
