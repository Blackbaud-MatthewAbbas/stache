#  Issues

<p class="alert alert-warning">Please note this is most likely a temporary page in order to highlight possible options.</p>

The ability to provide a way for developers to report issues with the API, including posting comments and seeing, is paramount in successfully deploying a successful API.  Expounding on issues and possible status updates could easily be communicated through our [blogging capability][blog] in the event the chosen Issue platform doesn't support it.

At the time of building this prototype, the issues capability built into the Microsoft Azure API Management Suite seemed best suited for our needs.
