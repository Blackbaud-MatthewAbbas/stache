# Blog

## Option 1 - Small World Labs

<p>Small World Labs, the community software that Blackbaud is switching to, does provide blogging capabilities.  One advantage to this solution is the ability to "tag" a blog post, including the ability to link to a page that filters the blogs by that tag.</p>

<a href="{{ site.communityblogurl }}" target="_blank" class="btn btn-primary">Visit Small World Labs Community</a>

## Option 2 - Custom Blog

<p>The technology used to build this documentation also natively supports blogging capability.</p>

<a href="{{ '/resources/blog/home/' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" class="btn btn-primary">Visit Custom Blog</a>
